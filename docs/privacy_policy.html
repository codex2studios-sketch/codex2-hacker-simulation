  <h1>Privacy Policy for Codex2 Hacker Simulator</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-11-11</p>

  <p>Codex2 Hacker Simulator (the "App") is an entertainment application published by Codex2 Studios ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use the App.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We do not require account creation or sign-in. We do not directly collect or store personal information. The App displays advertising via third-party ad networks (Google AdMob). Those third parties may collect device identifiers and other technical data to serve and measure ads. We describe these practices below and provide links to third-party privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not require you to create an account or provide a name, email, or other personal information within the App.</li>
    <li>The App does not store or transmit user-uploaded content or messages to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information Collected By Third Parties (AdMob)</h2>
  <p>The App integrates Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). AdMob and its partners may collect information from your device when ads are shown, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID (Android Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Device identifiers and hardware model</li>
    <li>IP address and coarse location (country, city level) — only if enabled on the device or for ad personalization</li>
    <li>Identifiers used for fraud prevention, ad serving and measurement</li>
    <li>App and device performance data, crash reports, and engagement metrics collected by the SDK</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not receive personal identifiers such as your name or email address from AdMob as part of standard ad serving. Google may combine data collected from the App with other information held by Google (see Google Privacy Policy).</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not use personal data ourselves for targeted marketing outside of what is handled by the ad networks.</li>
    <li>Advertising networks use collected data to deliver and measure ads, to prevent fraud, and to personalize ads if you have enabled ad personalization.</li>
    <li>We may use aggregated, non-identifiable analytics to improve the App experience (e.g., crash rates or feature usage) if provided by third-party services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ad request data flows directly from the device to the ad network (Google/AdMob) and their partners. We do not sell your personal data.</li>
    <li>Third-party analytics or ad providers may retain data according to their own policies. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies (links below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ads Personalization & Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset or opt out of ad personalization by changing Android settings for the Advertising ID (Settings → Google → Ads → Reset advertising ID or Opt out of Ads Personalization).</li>
    <li>Control ad personalization at Google's Ad Settings: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. If you believe your child under 13 has provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information where required by law.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not maintain servers that store personal data for App users. Any data collected by third parties is retained by those third parties and governed by their policies.</li>
    <li>We take commercially reasonable measures to protect information under our control, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Privacy Policies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob Policy &amp; SDK information</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>AdMob servers and other third-party services may process or store information in countries other than yours. Their privacy policies describe how they handle international data transfers.</p>

  <h2>Legal Rights and Data Requests</h2>
  <p>If you would like to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information we control, or have other questions about privacy, contact us (contact details below). We will respond to requests in accordance with applicable law.</p>
